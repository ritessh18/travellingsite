            <p>Our Founder & Director, Mr. Sudhir Patil, is a staunch believer in the philosophy of life, ‘The one who gives, should keep giving. The one who constantly takes from others, should one day take a leaf out of the giver’s book and learn the kind
                act of giving’. After all, it is only through giving that we are able to receive more than what we already have! Mr. Patil’s caring and giving nature often translates into his personal and professional life as he imparts knowledge, wisdom,
                information and good wishes to people around him. There is always something interesting to learn from and take back, when you are in conversation with Mr. Patil. His charming persona goes hand in hand with his positive attitude, as he
                easily approaches and strikes conversation with different people, resulting in a bevy of good friends, acquaintances all over India and around the world.</p>

            <p>When you listen to Sunila Patil talk about her journey in life and how her paths crossed with travel, you are automatically reminded of the inspiring words, ‘What is meant to be, will always find a way!’ She fits the bill perfectly when she
                describes herself as a ‘traveler who wants to discover the world’; and discover she does, with her amazing experiences and memorable travel stories that have taken her to almost 70 countries across the world. Being a Master’s Degree holder
                in Physiotherapy with a major in Neurology and a former research student at the university college of London, she worked in various hospitals of Mumbai over the years. Destiny welcomed her into the wonderful world of travel and from here
                on, there was no looking back! Travel for Sunila Patil, indeed came as a true calling and that is where she realized her passion and love for creating something new, always!</p>
